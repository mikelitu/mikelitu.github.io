Soft robots that grow through eversion/apical extension can effectively navigate fragile
environments such as ducts and vessels inside the human body. This paper presents the
physics-based model of a miniature steerable eversion growing robot. We demonstrate the
robotâ€™s growing, steering, stiffening and interaction capabilities. The interaction between two
robot-internal components is explored, i.e., a steerable catheter for robot tip orientation, and a
growing sheath for robot elongation/retraction. The behavior of the growing robot under different
inner pressures and external tip forces is investigated. Simulations are carried out within the
SOFA framework. Extensive experimentation with a physical robot setup demonstrates agreement
with the simulations. The comparison demonstrates a mean absolute error of 10 - 20% between
simulation and experimental results for curvature values, including catheter-only experiments,
sheath-only experiments and full system experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore physics-based modelling of a tendon-driven steerable eversion growing robot. While our work is motivated by early breast cancer detection through mammary duct inspection and uses our
MAMMOBOT robot prototype, our approach is general and relevant to similar growing robots
